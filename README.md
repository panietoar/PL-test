# PL-test

Test project.

I've decided to create this four widgets cause they bring me the opportunity to face different challenges.

I've used handlebars template engine for 2 of them, a custom template logic for the second one, and didn't used any engine for the last one.
The idea is to show different techniques.

I've used flex-box for positioning the widgets and also used css-grid to position elements in the Stats widget.

Scss was used as preprossesor and BEM as a naming/styling technique. It helps to mantain the styles scoped to its widget.

To run:

npm install then npm run start
